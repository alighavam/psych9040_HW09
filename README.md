# Cosine Similarity

Cosine Similarity is defined as the cosine of the angle between two N dimensional vectors. Cosine function can take a value between -1 to 1. If two vectors are parallel and in the same direction (i.e. angle = 0), the cosine angle (cosine similarity) between the two vectors is $cos(0) = 1$. If two vectors are perpendicular, their cosine angle will be $cose(90) = 0$. 

So, for any given vectors A and B, the cosine similarity is defined as:

$$
    cos(\theta) = \frac{A.B}{\lVert A\rVert  \|B\|}
$$
