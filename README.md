# Cosine Similarity

Cosine Similarity is defined as the cosine of the angle between two N dimensional vectors. Cosine function can take a value between -1 to 1. If two vectors are parallel and in the same direction (i.e. angle = 0), the cosine angle (cosine similarity) between the two vectors is $cos(0) = 1$.
